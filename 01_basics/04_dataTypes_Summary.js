//In Stack there copy is passed
//In heap , reference is there so original is changed

//so copy of hitesh choudhary dot com is assigned to another name
//when we assign chaiaurcode to anothername, another name is changed
//thererfore copy is changed
//original hiteshchoudharydotcom of myYoutubename is same.
